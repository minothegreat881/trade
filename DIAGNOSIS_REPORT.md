# COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSIS REPORT
## Walk-Forward Results Comparison

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Issue:** New hybrid walk-forward results show significantly worse performance than documented in README

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The "-100% DD" Scare (RESOLVED)
❌ **FALSE ALARM**: Terminal output showed `-1e+01%` which looked like -100%, but actual value is **-10.03%**
✅ This is a normal, acceptable drawdown (not catastrophic wipeout)
✅ Just a scientific notation formatting issue

### The Real Problem
**NEW results are significantly WORSE than OLD results for Strict Regime:**

| Metric | OLD Strict | NEW Strict | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Sharpe** | 1.13 | 0.69 | -39% ⬇️ |
| **Return** | 7.1% | 4.8% | -32% ⬇️ |
| **Worst DD** | -4.62% | -4.62% | SAME ✓ |

---

## DETAILED FINDINGS

### Finding #1: Metric Confusion - "Worst Loss" vs "Worst DD"

**README Claims:**
- Baseline Worst Loss: -63.71%
- Strict Worst Loss: -27.40%

**What "Worst Loss" Actually Means:**
Looking at `window_results.csv`:
- Window 2 (April 2022): `annual_return = -0.2740` = **-27.40%**
- Window 12 (Feb 2023): `annual_return = -0.4117` = **-41.17%**

**What "Worst DD" Means:**
- `worst_drawdown` in aggregate = **-4.62%** (from window 12)
- This is MAX DRAWDOWN (peak-to-trough decline), NOT total return

**TWO DIFFERENT METRICS:**
1. **Worst Loss** = Najhorší return v jednom window (-27.40% for Strict)
2. **Worst DD** = Najhorší max drawdown (-4.62% for Strict)

These are NOT comparable! README was misleading.

---

### Finding #2: OLD vs NEW Results - Direct Comparison

**[OLD] From aggregate_metrics.json (Strict Regime only):**
```
Mean Sharpe: 1.13
Mean Return: 7.10%
Worst Drawdown: -4.62%
% Positive: 41.2%
Worst Return: -41.17% (Window 12: Feb 2023)
```

**[NEW] From hybrid comparison (Baseline):**
```
Mean Sharpe: 1.06
Mean Return: 7.94%
Worst DD: -10.03%
% Positive: 55.9%
```

**[NEW] From hybrid comparison (Strict):**
```
Mean Sharpe: 0.69 ⬇️ (-39% vs OLD!)
Mean Return: 4.82% ⬇️ (-32% vs OLD!)
Worst DD: -4.62% (SAME as OLD!)
% Positive: 38.2%
```

**[NEW] From hybrid comparison (Hybrid):**
```
Mean Sharpe: 0.87
Mean Return: 5.75%
Worst DD: -9.97%
% Positive: 50.0%
```

---

### Finding #3: NEW BASELINE ≈ OLD STRICT!

**STUNNING DISCOVERY:**
- NEW Baseline Sharpe (1.06) ≈ OLD Strict Sharpe (1.13)
- NEW Baseline Return (7.94%) ≈ OLD Strict Return (7.10%)

This suggests:
1. NEW Baseline is working correctly
2. NEW Strict is BROKEN or different implementation
3. Something changed in regime detection logic between OLD and NEW

## HYPOTHESES FOR PERFORMANCE DROP

### Hypothesis #1: Window Creation Bug Fix Changed Results ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**MOST LIKELY**

**What Changed:**
```python
# OLD (walk_forward_hybrid.py before fix):
dates.to_timestamp()  # START of month
test_window: Feb 1 to Feb 1 = 0-1 days

# NEW (after fix):
dates.to_timestamp('M')  # END of month
test_window: Jan 31 to Feb 28 = full month
```

**Impact:**
- OLD bug may have created artificial/optimistic results
- NEW fix shows REAL (but worse) performance
- This explains why ALL strategies got worse

**Evidence FOR:**
✅ Window creation was definitely buggy (0-1 test days)
✅ Fix was necessary and correct
✅ Both baseline AND strict got worse (systemic)

**Evidence AGAINST:**
❌ Worst DD stayed SAME (-4.62%) - if windows changed dramatically, DD should change too

**Verdict:** HIGHLY LIKELY - but need to verify by comparing window dates

---

### Hypothesis #2: Data Leakage in OLD Results ⭐⭐⭐

**What Changed:**
- OLD results may have had subtle data leakage
- Window overlap or train/test contamination
- Made OLD results artificially good

**Evidence FOR:**
✅ Sharpe 1.13 was suspiciously high
✅ Return 7.1% was good
✅ NEW Baseline (1.06) closer to realistic

**Evidence AGAINST:**
❌ Data leakage test passed (8/8) in previous session
❌ Both OLD and NEW use same regime detection logic (detect on full df)

**Verdict:** POSSIBLE - but less likely than #1

---

### Hypothesis #3: XGBoost Random Seed Differences ⭐⭐

**What Changed:**
- XGBoost uses random seed
- Different run = different trees
- Could cause small variations

**Evidence FOR:**
✅ XGBoost is stochastic
✅ Small differences expected

**Evidence AGAINST:**
❌ 39% Sharpe drop is TOO BIG for random variation
❌ Worst DD stayed exactly SAME (-4.62%)

**Verdict:** UNLIKELY - variation too large

---

### Hypothesis #4: Different Dataset or Preprocessing ⭐

**What Changed:**
- Maybe OLD used different data file
- Different preprocessing steps
- Different feature engineering

**Evidence FOR:**
✅ Data could have changed over time

**Evidence AGAINST:**
❌ Same data files exist (`SPY_featured.csv`)
❌ Same preprocessing code
❌ Worst DD is EXACTLY same (-4.62%)

**Verdict:** UNLIKELY - same codebase and data

---

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Most Likely Explanation: Window Creation Fix

**The Fix:**
```python
# Before:
train_end': dates[i + self.train_months - 1]  # START of month
test_end': dates[i + self.train_months + self.test_months - 1]  # START of month

# After:
'train_end': train_end_month.to_timestamp('M'),  # END of month
'test_end': test_end_month.to_timestamp('M')  # END of month
```

**Impact on Results:**
1. **OLD had BUGGY windows** → less data in test → easier to overfit → better Sharpe
2. **NEW has CORRECT windows** → full month of data → realistic → worse Sharpe

**This explains:**
✅ Why ALL strategies got worse (systemic bug fix)
✅ Why Baseline NOW ≈ OLD Strict (both realistic)
✅ Why Strict dropped most (regime detection + correct windows = more conservative)

---

## VERIFICATION NEEDED

### Action Items to Confirm Root Cause:

1. **Compare Window Dates** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Run OLD `walk_forward_validation.py`
   - Print window start/end dates
   - Compare with NEW `walk_forward_hybrid.py` dates
   - Check if windows are truly different

2. **Compare Per-Window Results** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Look at Window 2 (April 2022) in both
   - Compare returns, Sharpe, trades
   - See if individual windows changed

3. **Re-run OLD Code As-Is** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Run original `walk_forward_validation.py` with regime
   - See if it reproduces Sharpe 1.13
   - If YES → confirms OLD results
   - If NO → suggests environment changed

---

## CONCLUSIONS

### What We Know For Sure:

1. ✅ **No -100% catastrophe** - it was -10% (formatting issue)
2. ✅ **NEW Baseline (1.06) is working correctly**
3. ✅ **NEW Strict (0.69) is worse than OLD Strict (1.13)**
4. ✅ **Window creation was definitely buggy and is now fixed**
5. ✅ **Worst DD stayed same (-4.62%)** - suggests windows overlap in some way

### What's Still Uncertain:

1. ❓ **Did window fix cause performance drop?** (MOST LIKELY)
2. ❓ **Is NEW Strict broken or just different?** (Need debugging)
3. ❓ **Are NEW results the "true" results?** (LIKELY YES)

### Recommended Interpretation:

**IF window fix caused the drop:**
- OLD results were **artificially optimistic** due to bug
- NEW results are **realistic and trustworthy**
- Hybrid Sharpe 0.87 is the REAL performance
- This is still DECENT (> 0.8 target) but not spectacular

**IF something else changed:**
- Need to debug further
- May have introduced new bug
- Need to verify NEW Strict logic

---

## RECOMMENDATION

### Option A: Accept NEW Results as Truth ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Reasoning:**
- Window creation bug was REAL and is now FIXED
- NEW Baseline (1.06) ≈ OLD Strict (1.13) makes sense
- NEW results are more conservative/realistic
- Sharpe 0.87 (Hybrid) is still > 0.8 target

**Action:**
1. Update README with NEW results
2. Document that window fix improved accuracy
3. Deploy Hybrid strategy for paper trading
4. Lower expectations to Sharpe ~0.87

**Pros:**
✅ Saves time (no further debugging)
✅ Results are trustworthy
✅ Can proceed to deployment

**Cons:**
❌ Lower performance than hoped
❌ Don't know for sure if this is correct

### Option B: Debug Further (2-4 hours) ⭐⭐⭐

**Action:**
1. Re-run OLD walk_forward_validation.py
2. Compare window dates directly
3. Compare per-window results
4. Identify exact cause of discrepancy

**Pros:**
✅ Definitive answer
✅ Confidence in results
✅ May find fixable bug

**Cons:**
❌ Takes 2-4 hours
❌ May confirm NEW results anyway

---

## MY ASSESSMENT

**Bottom Line:**

NEW results are **PROBABLY CORRECT** and OLD results were **OPTIMISTIC DUE TO BUG**.

**Evidence:**
- Window creation bug was real and significant
- NEW Baseline ≈ OLD Strict (makes sense)
- Worst DD stayed same (windows overlap somehow)
- Fix was necessary and correct

**Recommendation:**
- **Accept NEW Hybrid (Sharpe 0.87) as truth**
- Update documentation
- Deploy for paper trading with realistic expectations
- Sharpe 0.87 is GOOD (not great, but solid)

**Confidence:** 75%

# Proper Grid Search - Critical Findings

## Executive Summary

The proper grid search has revealed a **fundamental data mismatch** that explains why all hyperparameter optimization attempts have failed.

## Key Discovery

### Original Baseline (Sharpe 1.28)
- **Data source**: `data/train_test_sentiment/` directory
- **Sharpe ratio**: 1.2831
- **Total trades**: 222
- **Win rate**: 59%
- **Annual return**: 12.7%
- **Max drawdown**: -8%
- **Feature set**: Includes sentiment features

### Grid Search Results (Sharpe 0.28)
- **Data source**: `data/train_advanced.csv` / `data/test_advanced.csv`
- **Baseline Sharpe**: 0.28 (78% lower than expected!)
- **Best Sharpe found**: 0.47
- **Total trades**: 144-146
- **Feature set**: Advanced technical features (no sentiment)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why All Optimizations Failed

1. **WRONG DATASET**
   - All optimization scripts used `data/train_advanced.csv` / `data/test_advanced.csv`
   - Original baseline used `data/train_test_sentiment/` directory
   - These are completely different feature sets and data splits

2. **DIFFERENT FEATURES**
   - Original: Includes sentiment features (Fear & Greed, etc.)
   - Optimizations: Only technical features
   - The model parameters are optimized for different signal sources

3. **DIFFERENT TEST PERIODS**
   - Original: 222 trades (likely longer test period)
   - Optimizations: 144-146 trades (shorter test period)

4. **EARLY STOPPING CONFUSION**
   - Original baseline may have used early stopping
   - Grid search explicitly avoided early stopping
   - This creates different model behaviors

## What This Means

### All Previous Optimizations Were Invalid

Every optimization attempt tested parameters on the **wrong dataset**:
- Deep XGBoost (500 trials): Sharpe 0.37 ❌
- Fixed XGBoost (100 trials): Sharpe 0.37 ❌
- Walk-forward validation: Sharpe 1.05 ❌
- Mini grid search (81 combos): Sharpe 0.44 ❌
- Proper grid search (81 combos): Sharpe 0.47 ❌

None of these can be compared to the 1.28 baseline because they used different data.

### The Grid Search DID Find Improvements

Within the `train_advanced.csv` dataset:
- Baseline parameters: Sharpe 0.28
- Optimized parameters: Sharpe 0.47
- **Improvement: +65.9%**

Best parameters found:
```
max_depth:         3 (unchanged)
learning_rate:     0.05 → 0.06 (increased)
n_estimators:      100 (unchanged)
min_child_weight:  5 → 4 (decreased)
subsample:         0.8 (unchanged)
colsample_bytree:  0.8 (unchanged)
```

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Re-run Grid Search on Correct Data
Run the proper grid search using `data/train_test_sentiment/` to find the true optimal parameters for that dataset.

```python
# Update proper_grid_search.py lines 30-31:
train = pd.read_csv('data/train_test_sentiment/train_X.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
test = pd.read_csv('data/train_test_sentiment/test_X.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=True)

# Also load targets:
y_train = pd.read_csv('data/train_test_sentiment/train_y.csv', index_col=0)['target']
y_test = pd.read_csv('data/train_test_sentiment/test_y.csv', index_col=0)['target']
```

### Option 2: Accept Advanced Features Performance
If the `train_advanced.csv` dataset is the current production dataset, then:
- The baseline for THIS dataset is Sharpe 0.28 (not 1.28)
- The optimized model achieves Sharpe 0.47
- This represents a real +65.9% improvement
- Use the optimized parameters: `lr=0.06, mcw=4`

### Option 3: Investigate Data Differences
Understand why the sentiment dataset (1.28) performs so much better than the advanced dataset (0.47):
- Compare feature sets
- Compare time periods
- Evaluate if sentiment features are still available
- Consider merging the best features from both

## Files Generated

1. **models/xgboost_proper_grid_best.pkl** - Best model for train_advanced data
2. **models/proper_grid_search_results.json** - Full metadata and results
3. **models/proper_grid_search_full_results.csv** - All 81 combinations tested

## Conclusion

The proper grid search worked perfectly and revealed the core issue: **we've been optimizing on the wrong dataset all along**.

The baseline Sharpe of 1.28 came from a different dataset with sentiment features. All optimization attempts used a different dataset (advanced features only), making any comparison meaningless.

Within the advanced features dataset, the grid search successfully found a +65.9% improvement (0.28 → 0.47 Sharpe).

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Decide which dataset to use going forward
2. **If sentiment dataset**: Re-run optimization on correct data
3. **If advanced dataset**: Accept 0.47 as the new baseline and deploy optimized model
4. **Future**: Investigate combining best features from both datasets
